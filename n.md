## Centralization/Decentralization
- __Centralization__: one focus of control
  - improve __efficiency with economies of scale__
  - simpler, consistent architecture
- __Decentralization__: distribute control
  - improve __speed and flexibility__ with local control
  - customization, meet customers' needs

## Remote Access
- connect user to the organization
- different needs, different support requirements

## Network Topology
- network architecture should
  - be clean and simple
  - provide for growth
  - ensure reliability through redundancy
- need to consider both physical and logical topologies
- typical forms: Star, Ring, Mesh

## Network Tools
- Ping
- Traceroute
- Netstat
- Arp
- Tcpdump/wireshark

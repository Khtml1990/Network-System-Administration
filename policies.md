# Policies
## Definition
- general philosophy that governs rules (like a constitution to a country)
- must be strictly followed
- well documented

## Policies in Namespaces
1. __Naming__ - Is the name permitted?
2. __Access__ - Is it secure and able to add/change/delete data?
3. __Longevity__ - Difficult to change once a name is established.
4. __Scope__ - locally or globally
5. __Consistency__ - High consistency means a same policy for everywhere.
6. __Reuse__ - How soon a name will be reused?

## Purpose
- without a policy
  - SA will not have a standard way to do things
  - SA hard to communicate
- it minimizes the effort of communications

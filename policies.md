# Policies
## Definition
- general philosophy that governs rules (like a constitution to a country)
- must be strictly followed
- well documented

## Policies in Namespaces
1. __[Naming](naming.md)__ - Is the name permitted?
2. __[Access](access.md)__ - Is it secure and able to add/change/delete data?
3. __[Longevity](longevity.md)__ - Difficult to change once a name is established.
4. __[Scope](scope.md)__ - locally or globally
5. __[Consistency](consistency.md)__ - High consistency means a same policy for everywhere.
6. __[Reuse](reuse.md)__ - How soon a name will be reused?

## Purpose
- without a policy
  - SA will not have a standard way to do things
  - SA hard to communicate
- it minimizes the effort of communications

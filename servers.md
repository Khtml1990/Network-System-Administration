# Servers
## Definition
- provide services, data or resources to other devices over a network
- for multiple users
- reliable
- must be always on (uptime)
- high end

## Purchase Considerations
- extensible
- better CPU
- better I/O
- rack mountable
- on-rack maintenance
- maintenance contract

## Vendors
- priority is __reliability__
- homogeneous 同质 VS heterogeneous 异质
- maintenance 管理 VS liberty 自由

## Cost
- highest compare to business and home lines
- performance driven
- ease of maintenance
- high service demand and lower downtime cause higher price

## Maintenance
- consider eventual failures
- large variety of same vendor

## Data Integrity
- data require protection
- configuration can be restored using similar mass produced units
- Windows fails to fully protect data
- UNIX based systems provide user management that separates data and offer further protection

## Data Centers
- server require specific environments
- cooling, humidity and power must be well controlled
- data center can provide the environment

## Client-Servers OS
- rare case: certain OS is required on the server
- servers do not need the same client

## Remote Access
- reach servers anytime anywhere
- server room too cold
- remote access allow users to access server in a humanly environment

## Mirroring
- RAID: a technique for data backup
- without backup mirroring, failure can result in a disaster
- human errors and software failures are excluded from mirroring protection

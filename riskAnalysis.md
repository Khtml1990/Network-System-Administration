# Risk Analysis
## Definition
- determine
  - types of disaster that an organization may be facing
  - chances of disaster happening
  - cost for mitigating 缓解 effects of disasrter
- usually done by external consultant/analyst (periodically)

## Formula
```
Budget for Risk Mitigation
=
(Cost of Disaster - Cost After Mitigation)
*
Risk of Disaster
```

## Example 
1. a company’s premises has `one chance in a million` of being affected by flooding, and if a flood would cost the company `$10 million`, the budget for mitigating the effects of the flood would be in the range of `$10`.
```
Budget for Risk Mitigation
= $10 million / 1 million
= $10
```

2. a company has `1 chance in 3,000` of being within 10 miles of the epicenter of an earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale, which would cause a loss of `$60 million`, the budget for reducing or preventing that damage would be in the `$20,000` range.
```
Budget for Risk Mitigation
= $60 million / 3,000
= $20,000
```

3. a large site that has a single point of failure whereby all LANs are tied together by one large router. If it died, it would take one day to repair, and there is a `70 percent chance that failure will occur once every 24 months`. The outage would cause 1,000 people to be unable to work for a day. The company estimates the loss of productivity to be `$68,000`. When the SAs go looking for redundancy for the router, the budget is approximately `$23,800`.
```
# 1/24 months = 1/2 years

Budget for Risk Mitigation
= (1/2 * 0.7) * $68,000
= $23,800
```
